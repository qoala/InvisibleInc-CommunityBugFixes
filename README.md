# Invisible Inc. Community Bug Fixes
### A mod for "Invisible Inc." by KLEI Entertainment

Bug fixes for base game content by the community. Depends on Sim Constructor by Cyberboy2000.

Some bug fixes can be enabled/disabled via campaign options.
The default for each option tries to fix behavior in the way most consistent with existing similar
behaviors or presumed intent from how the code was written. In some cases, this may leave the
vanilla behavior unchanged by default.
[Customizable Generation Presets](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1631664146)
allows saving personal preferences over which fixes to enable.
See [FIXES.md](FIXES.md) for details on individual fixes and their configuration options.

If using the debug menu (config `DEV = true`), also install [Expanded
Cheats](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1808555330). It rewrites part of the
debug menu to no longer rely on live reloading.
