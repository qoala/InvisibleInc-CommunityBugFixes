# Invisible Inc. Community Bug Fixes
### A mod for "Invisible Inc." by KLEI Entertainment

Bug fixes for base game content by the community. Depends on Sim Constructor by Cyberboy2000.

Some bug fixes can be enabled/disabled via campaign options.
In general, if the vanilla behavior is a crash or a non-fatal invalid state (such as a stationary
guard that's missing one of the data fields for normal stationary guard behavior), the default
for this mod is to replace it with a valid state closest to what the calling function/script appears
to have requested.
See [FIXES.md](FIXES.md) for details on individual fixes and their configuration options.
